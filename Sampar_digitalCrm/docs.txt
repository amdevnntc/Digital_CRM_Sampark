1:Creation of Location as Dynamic that should come dynamically from from database 
  like this locality should change which will be mapped thrugh Location
   Like if we select Delhi Location then all Locality should come AutoMatically
   we have to Perform one To Many Mapping 
   
      for this 2 entity classes 
         1  LocationEntity
            2 LocalityEntity  
   
   
   CREATE TABLE city_master(  
   city_id INT  ,  
   city_code VARCHAR(100) ,  
   city_Name VARCHAR(100) ,  
   PRIMARY KEY ( city_id )  
);  



CREATE TABLE locality_master(  
   locality_id INT  ,  
   city_id INT  ,
   Locality_Name VARCHAR(100) ,  
   PRIMARY KEY ( locality_id )  
);
